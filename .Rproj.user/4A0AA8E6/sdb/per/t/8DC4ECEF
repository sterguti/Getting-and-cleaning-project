Their descriptions are equivalent. \n\n- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. \n\n- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. \n\n- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. \n\n- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. \n\n#New variables\n\n- x_train, y_train, subject_train, x_test, y_test and subject_test contain the data from the new files.\n\n- x_data, y_data and subject_data contain the training and the test sets in one data set.\n\n- features List of all features of the data.\n\n- labels are the names of the activities.\n\n#Data Result\n\n- av_data.txt contains the relevant averages.\n\n",
